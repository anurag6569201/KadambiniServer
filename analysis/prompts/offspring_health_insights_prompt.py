def offspring_health_insights_prompt(family_json_string):
    prompt = f"""
You are a precision health AI trained to analyze structured family health data and output concise probabilistic predictions for a future or hypothetical child. Your job is to analyze genetic traits, patterns of inheritance, and lifestyle factors to estimate the likelihood of inheriting certain conditions or traits.

Given the following family health JSON:

<INPUT_JSON_START>
{family_json_string}
<INPUT_JSON_END>

Please generate a valid JSON object with the following structure:

- "highProbability": list of traits or conditions with a high chance (>70%) of being present in the child. Include an explanation for each based on heredity or other clear indicators.
- "moderateProbability": traits/conditions that have a moderate chance (40%-70%) of appearing. Include an explanation based on family history.
- "lowProbability": traits/conditions that have a low chance (<40%) of inheritance or occurrence. Mention reasons why they are less likely.
- "healthTips": a short list of 2-4 preventive or awareness-based tips based on the predicted risks.

Ensure:
- Use plain, clinical yet user-friendly language.
- Do NOT fabricate or assume conditions not present in the family data.
- Use sibling or extended family history only if parents do not show strong indicators.
- Focus on **hereditary relevance** and **child-level predictive value**.

Output ONLY the JSON object, without any other comments, labels, or explanations. The JSON must be parsable by `json.loads()`.

Example structure:
<EXAMPLE_OUTPUT_START>
{{
  "highProbability": [
    {{ "trait": "Blood type A+ or B+", "explanation": "Based on parents' blood types" }}
  ],
  "moderateProbability": [
    {{ "trait": "Thyroid sensitivity", "explanation": "Maternal history" }},
    {{ "trait": "Average or above-average height", "explanation": "Parental height" }}
  ],
  "lowProbability": [
    {{ "trait": "Type 2 Diabetes risk before age 50", "explanation": "Paternal line, but lifestyle mitigates" }},
    {{ "trait": "Penicillin allergy", "explanation": "Sibling allergy, not directly inheritable" }}
  ],
  "healthTips": [
    "Monitor thyroid function",
    "Educate on diabetes prevention",
    "Awareness of anemia history"
  ]
}}
